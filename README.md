# LiDAR Place Recognition

Blank project scaffold for a LiDAR place recognition pipeline. The implementation is intentionally left as TODO for Sobu-kun.

## Project Goals
- Implement a place recognition pipeline using LiDAR data from a public dataset.
- Design a descriptor for LiDAR scans.
- Implement a matching algorithm and retrieval mechanism.
- Evaluate with standard metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AP, PR/ROC curves).
- Provide a short report with method description, plots, and discussion.

## Quick Start (Scaffold Only)
1. Install dependencies (to be filled in).
2. Download or link a dataset into `data/raw/` (kept out of git).
3. Implement the TODOs in `src/` and `eval/`.

## Structure
See the folder layout in the repository root for guidance on where to place code, data, results, and report assets.
